    <h1>INDIA</h1>

    <p>India (Hindi: Bhārat), officially the Republic of India is a country in South Asia. 
        It is the second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by land area, and the most populous democracy in
         the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on 
         the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and 
         Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; 
         its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.

    <p>Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago. 
        Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly 
        diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity. Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the 
        western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation 
        of the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had 
        diffused into India from the northwest, unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of 
        Hinduism in India. The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions. 
        By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism, and Buddhism and Jainism had 
        arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity. Early political consolidations gave rise to the 
        loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin. Their collective era was suffused with 
        wide-ranging creativity, but also marked by the declining status of women, and the incorporation of 
        untouchability into an organised system of belief. In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported 
        Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.
